At that time, her vital signs were within normal limits, including SpO2 (i.e., 98 % on room air) (Fig. 1A). On 18 February, she complained of cough and exacerbation of malaise and anorexia and had an associated 3 kg body weight loss. She was referred to our hospital because of a bilateral reticular shadow seen on chest X-rays (Fig. 1B) and ground-glass opacity (GGO) adjacent to the pleura seen on chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 1C, D). At the time of her visit, she had a temperature of 37.7 ?C; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; heart rate, 106 beats/min (regular); blood pressure, 139/63 mmHg; and SPO2 of 95 % on room air. Admission blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (7.9 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (106 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (80 U/L), ?-glutamyltransferase (153 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (372 U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (383 U/L). Other blood test results were within the normal range. COVID-19 was suggested based on her prolonged clinical symptoms, travel history, and chest X-ray and CT findings. We thus performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of a sputum specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection. A rapid influenza test, conducted simultaneously, was positive for influenza A virus, and she was started on oseltamivir with ceftriaxone 2 g/day and azithromycin 500 mg/day to cover possible bacterial infections. One day after oseltamivir initiation, on 19 February, she became afebrile. The PCR assay performed on admission tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 20 February. By 21 February, her general malaise had worsened. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1E) and CT (Fig. 1F, G), re-examined on 25 February, showed improvements in previously noted GGO, appearing more like a consolidation. Given the improvement in her clinical symptoms and CT findings, another PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on 26 February which tested still positive. Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing on 1 and 2 March tested negative, and the patient was discharged on 5 March. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1H) and CT (Fig. 1I, J) images obtained a day before discharge showed improvements of previously noted consolidation and GGO.
