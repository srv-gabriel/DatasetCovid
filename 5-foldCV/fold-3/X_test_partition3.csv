However, her fever relapsed on 30th January 2020 with productive cough and dyspnea.

Bilateral crepitations were heard on auscultation and chest X-ray revealed multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 2 (a)).

She could not wear a surgical mask as she was on oxygen therapy through a simple facemask (Soundway?, Ningbo Shengyurui Medical Appliances Co. Ltd, Ningbo, China; Figure 2(b)). She also had frequent coughs while residing in the ward. She became more hypoxic around 18:00 h and required an increase in oxygen therapy to 8 L/min, delivered through the same facemask.

Her other medications included ramipril, aspirin, alfacalcidol, and amiloride. She presented on March 5 with cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
